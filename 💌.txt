That time Robin texted Howard Dean from the Vermont statehouse to heckle him about his official portrait.
I got to meet up with Robin for dinner in Portland, and she taught me about aged beef, something I knew nothing about. That was just one of probably a hundred times Robin taught me about something I knew very little about. Always in the most straightforward manner, delivered with passion and conviction (whether about state IT budgets or aged beef). 
Robin's ability to have a lunch or dinner buddy anywhere taught me to make the most of the opportunities we have to travel and connect with great people. Also, she always knows where to go and what to order. 
Robin also introduced my cousin to Howard Dean. I think she likes my cousin more than she likes me 🤔
I got sent an anonymous stuffed animal capybara to your federal workplace and awkwardly texting your on-again/off-again person to see if was them only to find out it was Robin!
A huge amount of the knowledge I've collected about conferences and states and how to get sh*t done has been from Robin. Thank you for setting us up and always being willing to teach.
Robin taught me about the world under Chicago and gave me tips on where to go running.
Robin flew herself to a workshop and when it was over, she was the first one out of town.
Robin knows how to pull the levers of power and just talk to people in such an effective way while keeping their needs and wants at the center of it all. That's a superpower.
Robin didn't make fun of Colonel Sanders, even though we all wanted to.
Robin yelled at us for not getting on the train even though we didn't have tickets. Then she got us into an unmetered taxi.
Robin knows where the best crab cakes are.
If you ever go to the City Museum in St. Louis with Robin, be prepared! She runs and jumps as much as any of the kids!
Robin's pep talks never fail to inspire me and give me confidence.
